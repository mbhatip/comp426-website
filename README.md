Welcome to my project. The idea behind it is to make a very basic stock market game, where you can buy and sell stocks using the previous day's closing price.

make a settings.ini file in this directory with following format:

```
[DEFAULT]
token = put polygon api token here
host = hosting ip address here
port = 79
```
